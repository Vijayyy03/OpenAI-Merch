## 🎯 **Project Overview**

## Overview
OpenAI-Merch is an automated backend pipeline that generates and publishes AI-created product listings using multiple APIs and programming languages. The pipeline simulates a mini eCommerce product automation system, generating product ideas, images, mockups, and publishing them via **real Shopify integration** or a fake API endpoint.

**Languages Used:**
- Python (AI, automation, Shopify integration)
- JavaScript (Node.js, mockup generation)
- PHP (Fake publishing endpoint - optional)

## 🆕 **New: Shopify Integration**

The project now includes **real Shopify API integration** that allows you to:
- ✅ Upload AI-generated products to a real Shopify store
- ✅ Automatically create product listings with images
- ✅ Publish products programmatically
- ✅ Manage inventory and pricing

### **Two Modes Available:**

1. **🛍️ Shopify Mode** (Real eCommerce)
   - Connects to actual Shopify store
   - Uploads real products for sale
   - Full eCommerce functionality

2. **🧪 Simulation Mode** (Testing)
   - Uses fake PHP endpoint
   - Perfect for testing and development
   - No real store required

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Python (Product Generator & Orchestrator)
- Navigate to `python/` directory.
- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Add your OpenAI API key to a `.env` file:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
  ```

### 2. JavaScript (Mockup Visualizer)
- Navigate to `js/` directory.
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Add a PNG mockup template as `template.png` in the `js/` directory.

### 3. Shopify Integration (Optional - Real eCommerce)
- Follow the complete setup guide: `SHOPIFY_SETUP.md`
- Add Shopify credentials to your `.env` file:
  ```
  SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
  SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
  ```

### 4. PHP (Fake Product Publisher - Optional)
- Navigate to `php/` directory.
- Start the PHP server:
  ```
  php -S localhost:8000
  ```

## Running the Pipeline

### 🛍️ **Shopify Mode (Recommended - Real eCommerce)**
```bash
# Navigate to python directory
cd python

# Run the Shopify-integrated pipeline
python orchestrator_shopify.py
```

**What happens:**
1. AI generates product content and image
2. JavaScript creates professional mockup
3. Product is uploaded to your real Shopify store
4. You can publish it immediately or keep as draft

### 🧪 **Simulation Mode (Testing)**
```bash
# Ensure PHP server is running
cd php
php -S localhost:8000

# In another terminal, run the simulation pipeline
cd python
python orchestrator.py
```

**What happens:**
1. AI generates product content and image
2. JavaScript creates professional mockup
3. Data is sent to fake PHP endpoint
4. Final payload is saved locally

## Sample Outputs
